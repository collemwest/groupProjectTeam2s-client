      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Classic Cinema has been the iconic home of cinema in the Dandenongs
        since it opened with MGMâ€™s David Copperfield on November 22, 1935. Since
        its opening, it has been the home of every novelty movie from the
        classic "Drakula", all the way to the most modern type of movies. The
        cinema had to be rennovated a total of 3 times due to it sustaining
        severe damage around 1985 from a very strong earthquake.

        Nowadays, the Classic cinema is owned by Eddie Tamirand managed by
        Danielle Burgess. With a total of 8 screens all equipped with the latest
        dolby digital atmos sound systems, Classic Cinema offers an amazing
        viewing experience for any kind of movie and for kids and adults alike.

        Our main auditorium boasts 309 seats in a modern 21st century cinema.
        Over summer, the Cameo Outdoor Cinema screens cult classic and first
        release films amidst the picturesque surrounds of the Dandenong Ranges.

        On top of the crisp indoor experience, Classic Cinema operates 2 outdoor
        viewing areas for the majority of spring, summer and autumn. Adults can
        enjoy watching their favourite movies along with their families, while
